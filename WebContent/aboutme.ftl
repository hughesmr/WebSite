			My name is Michael Hughes. I created this website as a way to show off the things I am learning, to learn new skills, 
			and maybe create a few tutorials.

			I graduated from Washington State University with my BS in Computer Science in 2013. Directly after that I
			 went to Jive Software for a few years and decided I wanted a change. I then packed up all of my stuff and
			  moved to the east coast to work at General Dynamics. Eventually I will head back to the west coast but for 
			  now I get to explore a part of the country I had never really seen before all while gaining valuable experience.

			I love classic sports cars and I currently spend a lot of time working on my 69 MGB or my fathers 66 Jaguar 
			E-Type so there may be a few posts here and there about that. If I am not working on cars I spend a lot of time working on 
			coding projects which also allows me time to play around with micro controllers and Raspberry Piâ€™s.

		That is pretty much me. You can view some past coding projects by clicking the Git Hub link on the left side of the screen 
		(I hope to add some newer code shortly).
